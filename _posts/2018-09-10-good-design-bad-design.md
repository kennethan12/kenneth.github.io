You can write regular [markdown](http://markdowntutorial.com/) here and Jekyll will automatically convert it to a nice webpage.  I strongly encourage you to [take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown](http://markdowntutorial.com/) - it'll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/headings/tables/etc.

**Good Design, Bad Design**

Interested in what I think is [good design](https://kennethan12.github.io/assignments/good/good-design/) and [bad design](https://kennethan12.github.io/assignments/bad/bad-design/)? Check these out.
