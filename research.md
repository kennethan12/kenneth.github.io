### Response to "Web Design Issues when Searching for Information in a Small Screen Display," by Loel Kim and Michael J. Abers in The University of Memphis, 2001.

I've decided to respond to this paper because, although it is outdated, it still very much relates to an important quality in our project: searching for a specific information. Kim and Abers have conducted this study long before the first smartphone ever came to existence. They call a small screen device a "personal digital assistant" (PDA), because they believed that soon these small handheld devices will "supplant the desktop computer as ubiquitous technology," which is exactly how our society today has turned out. They were wondering if a PDA would be as efficient as a web interface in offering information that a user searches for. They had 120 participants go through a series of cases where a PDA screen, which a user can scroll, will have information that a user is told to search for in the beginning, middle, and end of a textual article, as the two conductors believed that finding information in the middle and end would show more trouble. They hypothesized that 

1) Users will have more errors on a PDA, 
2) Users will take more time searching on a PDA, 
3) Users will experience more difficulty locating information in the middle of end of pages on a PDA, and 
4) Users will experience more difficulty locating textual information than numerical statistics on a PDA.

Ignoring the complexity of the design a web page must go through to accommodate a small screen like a PDA, Kim and Abers found that users did not show any cases of making errors (such as finding the wrong information or clicking the wrong link by accident) on a PDA, as they were as efficient in searching as when they would be on a computer. They were right in that it did take longer to search for information on a PDA,
