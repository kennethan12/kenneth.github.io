## Outline ##

1. Intro
2. We are not the user
   - We often designed based on what we thought curators wanted
   - Our usability testing and heuristic evaluations told us the complete opposite
   - Never assume what the users might want, involve them in the process (UX method)
3. Keeping it simple but functional
   - Our initial prototype had way more screens and functions to "accommodate" the user
   - We realized that test users would never reach a given goal
        - Confusing buttons, weird layouts, unnecessarily information...
   - We cut it short. Got rid of half the screens. Made the layout simple. Concise, specific information
   - Related to first point: don't assume users need more help than they need...
4. Don't be afraid of feedback
   - Feedback is one of the most important things in designing
   - Personally, I made sure that I got everything done at once instead of taking steps to ensure that I don't get much negative feedback
   - But that led to wasting time and also receiving negative feedback anyways
   - But negative feedback helps us fix our problems, make our design better
5. Make it accessible -- for all types of users
   - We chose very simple colors -- pink and white color scheme, so nothing is too complicated for colorblind users
   - Buttons on reachable positions on the screen so people with mobility problems don't have too much trouble
   - All artworks/exhibits/buttons are labeled for screen readers
   - It's important to accommodate for all sorts of people so that there aren't a lot of problems for a certain type of user
6. Everything has an ethical consequence
   - How much information that we gather are considered private? How much information do we use in general?
   - Our design doesn't cause any harm -- but it's important to keep it in mind
   - ACM Code of Ethics & The Signal Code from Harvard are very useful to constnatly have in mind
   - Five personal points of ethics:
        - Citation for using intellectual property of others
        - Privacy and Protection
        - A user's access of their own data is a right
        - Do not harm others
7. Conclusion
